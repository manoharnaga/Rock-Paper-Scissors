### This is a problem-solution assignment done as a part of the course **Automata Theory**
<br>



### **In 1.Cellular Automata**
### rule.py's follow the Cellular Automato's given in Assignment.pdf

<br>

### **In 2.Games**
### I have made a **rps.cpp** that plays ***Rock-Paper-Scissor*** with the given input finite state automaton(**fsm.txt**) and wins for almost 60% times
### change 2.Games/student_programs/fsm.txt, 2.Games/student_programs/rps.cpp to test your rps program# Rock-Paper-Scissors
